# Generating Proofs: Basics

An end-to-end flow of proving `f(x) = y` with the SP1 zkVM involves the following steps:

- Define `f` using normal Rust code and compile it to an ELF (covered in the [writing programs](../writing-programs/basics.md) section).
- Setup a proving key (`pk`) and verifying key (`vk`) for the program given the ELF. The proving key contains all the information needed to generate a proof and includes some post-processing on top of the ELF, while the verifying key is a compact representation of the ELF that contains all the information needed to verify a proof and is much smaller than the ELF itself.
- Generate a proof `π` using the SP1 zkVM that `f(x) = y` with `prove(pk, x)`.
- Verify the proof `π` using `verify(vk, x, y, π)`.

To make this more concrete, let's walk through a simple example of generating a proof for a Fiboancci program inside the zkVM.

## Fibonacci

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../examples/fibonacci/script/src/main.rs}}
```

You can run the above script in the `script` directory with `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release`.

## Generating a groth16 proof with onchain verification

The proofs generated by SP1 are not verifiable onchain, as they are non-constant size and STARK verification on Ethereum is very expensive. To generate a proof that can be verified onchain, we use performant STARK recursion to combine SP1 shard proofs into a single STARK proof and then wrap this in a SNARK proof. Our `ProverClient` has a function for this called `prove_groth16`. Behind the scenes, this function will first generate a normal SP1 proof, then recursively combine all of them into a single proof using the STARK recursion protocol. Finally, the proof is wrapped in a SNARK proof using Groth16.

### Run the script

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../examples/fibonacci/script/bin/groth16.rs}}
```

You can run the above script with `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin groth16 --release` in `examples/fibonacci/script`.

## Build Script

If you want your program crate to be built automatically whenever you build/run your script crate, you can add a `build.rs` file inside of `script/` (at the same level as `Cargo.toml`):

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../examples/fibonacci/script/build.rs}}
```

Make sure to also add `wp1-helper` as a build dependency in `script/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
wp1-helper = { git = "https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wp1.git" }
```

If you run `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -vv`, you will see the following output from the build script if the program has changed, indicating that the program was rebuilt:
