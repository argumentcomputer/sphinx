/// Executes a block of code unconstrained by the VM. This macro is useful for running code that
/// helps provide information to the program but does not need to be constrained by the VM. For
/// example, running `ecrecover` is expensive in the VM but verifying a signature when you know the
/// public key is not. `unconstrained` can be used to provide the public key without spending VM CPU
/// cycles.
///
/// Any changes to the VM state will be reset at the end of the block. To provide data to the VM,
/// use `io::hint` or `io::hint_slice`, and read it using `io::read` or `io::read_vec`.
